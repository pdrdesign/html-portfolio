            <H2>The Best Games according to Pierce</H2>
            <H3>My top 3 Video games</H3>
                <Hr>
            <H4>Mx vs ATV Reflex</H4>
            <img src="./assets/images/mx_vs_atv_reflex.jpg" height="250">
                    <p>Mx vs ATV Reflex was and still is the pinical of dirt bike racing games.
                        It introduced dual stick control for controlling the rider and dirt bike,
                        and also introduced terrain deformation. The game was great and introduced a new
                        era of motocross video games.
                    </p>
            <H4>Halo 3</H4>
            <img src="./assets/images/Halo 3.jpg" height="300">
                    <p>This was the top of all shooters back then. The arena shooter was fun to play 
                        with the whole family and friends. Doesnt matter what skills you had in the game.
                        The more you played the more you figured out how to do the little tricks to give you
                        and edge over your opponents. This game was able to seperate the casual player from
                        the competitive player. Something we are missing now-a-days.

            <H4>Pokemon Gold/Silver</H4>
            <img src="./assets/images/Pokemon Gold and Silver.jpg">
                    <p>Pokemon has always been a key staple of my life. Out of all the pokemon games though
                        I think Pokemon Gold/Silver were my favorite. Something about being able to go from
                        Johto region to the Kanto region was really cool. You still havent been able to do 
                        that in any other pokemon game since then.
